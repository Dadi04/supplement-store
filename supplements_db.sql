4	OstroVit Creatine Monohydrate	OstroVit Creatine Monohydrate Supreme Pure 300g	Creatine	Creatine Monohydrate	OstroVit	What is creatine monohydrate and what is it for?\r\n      Creatine is a compound that the human body produces by itself and that supplies the muscles with energy. It is produced in the liver, pancreas and kidneys, and is transported to the muscles through the bloodstream. When it reaches the muscles, it is converted into phosphocreatine (creatine phosphate), which supplies adenosine diphosphate (ADP) with a phosphate group necessary for the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the immediate energy source for our muscles.\r\n\r\nCreatine is found in many foods, so its use is a natural supplement aimed at improving muscle mass and getting extra energy. A particularly rich source of creatine is fish meat, herring, salmon and tuna, but also beef. However, in order to provide additional amounts of creatine monohydrate, adequate supplementation is required, and it is not possible to take in such quantities of food during the day to significantly increase its intake.\r\n\r\nHow creatine works\r\n      This is a favorite supplement for athletes, because it gives visible results in a very short time - in just two weeks, it can significantly increase muscle mass, as well as general fitness, which results in the possibility of intense training thanks to increased energy levels. In addition, creatine directly affects the speed of recovery of the body from the stress caused by strenuous training.\r\n\r\nIn the world of professional and recreational sports, there is almost no athlete who does not use creatine and who does not know what it is for. Creatine's ability to increase muscle energy reserves comes from its activity in protein synthesis, which prevents muscle breakdown. Another extremely important feature of creatine is its role in the rehydration of muscle cells, which is extremely important for the growth of muscle fibers and their strength.\r\n\r\nCreatine is often recommended for many conditions and diseases, because it reduces cholesterol and triglyceride levels, has an anti-inflammatory effect (arthritis), protects the central nervous system, alleviates the GAMT defect that leads to a lack of creatine in the brain, acts in diseases related to muscle atrophy, supplements vegetarian diet, increases strength and endurance in heart diseases.\r\n\r\nEffects of creatine monohydrate on the body\r\n- accelerates the increase in muscle mass and the achievement of muscle definition\r\n- increases energy, strength and endurance\r\n- accelerates weight loss processes\r\n- accelerates recovery processes after intense training and physical stress\r\n- reduces fatigue\r\n- is an ideal dietary supplement for vegetarians who do not get enough of it from food\r\n\r\nRecommended dosage and method of use\r\n      Dissolve 5 g of powder in 200 ml of water. Drink more water during supplementation.\r\nWarning: people with impaired kidney function should not take creatine.	25.00	300	Watermelon	f	0	supplement_store/static/supplement_store/images/product_images/OstroVit Creatine Monohydrate Supreme Pure 300g/4_OstroVit-Creatine-Monohydrate-300-g-16607_1.png	supplement_store/static/supplement_store/images/product_images/OstroVit Creatine Monohydrate Supreme Pure 300g/4_OstroVit-Creatine-Monohydrate-300-g-16607_2.png	supplement_store/static/supplement_store/images/product_images/OstroVit Creatine Monohydrate Supreme Pure 300g/4_OstroVit-Creatine-Monohydrate-300-g-16607_3.png		f	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f	0	0
